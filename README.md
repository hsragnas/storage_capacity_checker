python script to calculate real storage capacity from advertised TB or GB

# Real Storage Capacity Calculator
When you buy a hard drive or SSD, the storage shown on your computer is often less than what's advertised. This is because manufacturers use decimal units for example (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes), while computers use binary units (1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes)

This Python script calculates the actual usable storage.

## Why I Made This
I noticed the size shown in my pc never matched what was printed on the box. I made this because I’ve always wondered why a “1TB” drive only shows up as 931GB on my computer. If you’ve noticed that too, this script quickly explains why it happens and helps you figure out the actual space you’ll get.
